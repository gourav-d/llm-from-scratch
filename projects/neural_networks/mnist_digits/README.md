# Project 2: MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier 🔢

**Build a neural network that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9)**

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A neural network that reads 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits and classifies them into 10 classes (0, 1, 2, ..., 9).

**Accuracy Target:** 95-97%

## 🤔 Why This Project?

### The "Hello World" of Computer Vision

MNIST is the most famous dataset in deep learning:
- ✅ **Visual and satisfying** - See the network "learn to see"!
- ✅ **Multi-class classification** - 10 classes instead of 2
- ✅ **Real benchmark** - Compare with academic papers
- ✅ **Image data** - Foundation for CNNs and computer vision

### Real-World Applications

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Form processing and digitization
- Check reading in banks
- Zip code recognition
- Any digit recognition task

## 📊 Project Status

🚧 **Coming Soon!**

This project will be created with:
- Complete implementation (simple and advanced versions)
- MNIST dataset loader
- Visualization of digits and predictions
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Comprehensive explanations

**Expected completion:** After Email Spam Classifier

## 🏗️ Planned Architecture

```
Input Layer (784)  →  Hidden Layer (128)  →  Hidden Layer (64)  →  Output Layer (10)
  [28x28 pixels]         [ReLU]                  [ReLU]              [Softmax]

3-layer deep network!
```

---

## 📈 Expected Results

```
Epoch 20: Train Acc: 97.2%, Test Acc: 95.8%

Confusion Matrix shows:
- 0-9 digits classified correctly 95%+ of the time
- Common mistakes: 4 vs 9, 3 vs 5, 7 vs 1
```

## ⏭️ For Now

**Complete Email Spam Classifier first!**

This will prepare you for:
- Working with neural networks
- Understanding training loops
- Evaluating models

Then come back here for image classification! 🚀
