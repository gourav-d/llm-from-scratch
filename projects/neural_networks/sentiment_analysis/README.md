# Project 3: Sentiment Analysis 😊😞

**Build a neural network that understands if movie reviews are positive or negative**

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A neural network that reads movie review text and classifies sentiment as:
- **Positive** (😊) - "This movie was great!"
- **Negative** (😞) - "Waste of time and money"

**Accuracy Target:** 85-88%

---

## 🤔 Why This Project?

### Natural Language Understanding

This project bridges simple text processing to real NLP:
- ✅ **More advanced than bag-of-words** - Uses word embeddings
- ✅ **Direct path to transformers** - Prepares for Module 4!
- ✅ **Real NLP task** - Sentiment is fundamental to LLMs
- ✅ **Test on your own text** - Write reviews and test them!

### Real-World Applications

- Product review analysis (Amazon, Yelp)
- Social media monitoring (Twitter sentiment)
- Customer feedback processing
- Brand reputation management
- Movie/restaurant recommendation systems

## 📊 Project Status

🚧 **Coming Soon!**

This project will be created with:
- Movie review dataset (IMDB or similar)
- Word embedding layer (simple version)
- More sophisticated text preprocessing
- Attention to word context
- Bridge to transformer concepts

**Expected completion:** After MNIST Classifier

## 🏗️ Planned Architecture

```
Input (Text)  →  Embedding (100)  →  Hidden (64)  →  Output (1)
  [Words]         [Word vectors]       [ReLU]         [Sigmoid]

Learns word meanings from data!
```

---

## 📈 Expected Results

```
Epoch 30: Test Accuracy: 87.5%

Example predictions:
"Absolutely brilliant film!" → Positive (98%)
"Terrible waste of time" → Negative (95%)
"It was okay, not great" → Negative (62%) [uncertain!]
```

## 🔗 Connection to LLMs

This project directly prepares you for:
- **Word embeddings** - How LLMs represent words
- **Context understanding** - How meaning changes
- **Sequence processing** - Text as ordered data
- **Attention mechanism** - What transformers add (Module 4!)

---

## ⏭️ For Now

**Complete the previous projects first:**
1. ✅ Email Spam Classifier (text basics)
2. ✅ MNIST Digits (image data)
3. → Then this project (advanced NLP)!

This is the **final project** before Module 4: Transformers! 🚀

---

**Status:** 🚧 In Development
**Prerequisites:** Complete Email Spam + MNIST
**Recommended:** Complete Module 3 fully
