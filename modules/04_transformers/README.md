## 🚀 Why Transformers?

### The Problem with What We've Learned So Far

**From Projects 1-3, we used:**
- Bag-of-words: Ignores word order
- Feed-forward networks: Can't understand context

**Example problem:**
```
"The cat sat on the mat"
"The mat sat on the cat"

With bag-of-words → SAME representation!
But completely different meaning!
```

### The Transformer Solution

**Attention mechanism solves this:**
```
"The cat sat on the mat"
      ↓
Attention learns:
- "cat" relates strongly to "sat" (subject-verb)
- "sat" relates to "mat" (verb-object)
- "on" relates to both "sat" and "mat" (preposition)

→ Understands CONTEXT and RELATIONSHIPS!
```

## 📚 Module Overview

### What Makes Transformers Special?

**Before transformers (2017):**
- RNNs/LSTMs: Process words sequentially (slow!)
- Can't look at all words at once
- Limited context understanding

**After transformers (2017-present):**
- ✅ Process all words in parallel (fast!)
- ✅ Attention to entire sentence at once
- ✅ Unlimited context (theoretically)
- ✅ Powers GPT, BERT, ChatGPT, all modern LLMs!

**The Breakthrough:**
> "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017)
>
> One of the most cited papers in AI history!

## 🛠️ What You'll Build

### Example 1: Simple Attention
```python
# Compute attention between query and keys
attention_weights = softmax(query @ keys.T / sqrt(d_k))
output = attention_weights @ values

# See which words the model focuses on!
```

### Example 2: Self-Attention Layer
```python
# Transform input to Q, K, V
Q = X @ W_q
K = X @ W_k
V = X @ W_v

# Compute attention
attention_output = self_attention(Q, K, V)
```

### Example 3: Multi-Head Attention
```python
# 8 heads, each learning different patterns
heads = [attention_head_i(X) for i in range(8)]
output = concatenate(heads) @ W_o
```

### Example 4: Complete Transformer Block
```python
# Full transformer layer
x = x + multi_head_attention(x)  # + residual
x = layer_norm(x)
x = x + feed_forward(x)  # + residual
x = layer_norm(x)
```

### Example 5: Mini-GPT
```python
# Simple GPT-style model
for block in transformer_blocks:
    x = block(x)
logits = x @ W_output  # Predict next token
```

## 💡 Key Insights You'll Gain

### 1. Why Attention Works
```
Traditional: All words treated equally
Attention: Important words get more weight

"The cat sat on the mat and looked at the bird"
                                          ↑
When predicting next word, "bird" is most relevant!
```

### 2. How GPT Generates Text
```
Input: "The cat sat on the"
       ↓
Multi-layer transformer processing
       ↓
Output probabilities: ["mat": 0.7, "chair": 0.2, "floor": 0.1]
       ↓
Sample: "mat"
```

### 3. Why Transformers Scale
```
RNN: Must process sequentially
- 100 words = 100 sequential steps
- Can't parallelize

Transformer: Processes all at once
- 100 words = 1 parallel step
- Fully parallelizable on GPUs!

→ This is why GPT-3 (175B parameters) is possible!
```
