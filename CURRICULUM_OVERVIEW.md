## 💡 Learning Tips

### For .NET Developers:

1. **Embrace the differences**
   - Python is not C# - that's okay!
   - Some things are simpler (no semicolons!)
   - Some things are different (indentation!)

2. **Use your C# knowledge**
   - Same programming concepts
   - Different syntax
   - Lots of similarities in OOP

3. **Practice, practice, practice**
   - Type the code, don't copy-paste
   - Experiment and break things
   - Learn from errors

4. **Use Claude Code**
   - Ask questions anytime
   - "Explain this in terms of C#"
   - "Why does this work this way?"

5. **Be patient**
   - Learning takes time
   - It's okay to review material
   - Celebrate small wins!
