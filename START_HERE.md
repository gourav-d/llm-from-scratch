## 📖 How to Use This Course

### Reading Lessons
1. Open the markdown file (`.md`)
2. Read carefully - don't skip
3. Compare Python to C# examples
4. Try the code examples yourself
5. Ask Claude if anything is unclear

### Running Code Examples
```bash
# Navigate to examples folder
cd modules/01_python_basics/examples

# Run any example
python example_01_basics.py
```

**Pro Tip:** Modify the examples! Change values, add your own code, break things and fix them.

### Taking Quizzes
1. Open `quizzes/quiz_module_1.md`
2. Read each question
3. Try to answer without looking
4. Click to reveal answer
5. Understand why the answer is correct

### Doing Labs
1. Open `labs/lab_module_1.md`
2. Read the exercise
3. Try to solve it yourself
4. If stuck, peek at hints
5. Compare with provided solution
6. Understand the solution approach

## 🎯 Your First Hour - Action Plan

**Right now, do this:**

1. **5 min:** Install Python (if not installed)
2. **5 min:** Set up virtual environment
3. **5 min:** Run the example file
4. **30 min:** Read `01_variables_and_types.md`
5. **15 min:** Try the practice exercise in the lesson

**After your first hour:**
- You'll understand Python variables vs C#
- You'll have run your first Python program
- You'll be ready for Lesson 2!

---

## 💻 Recommended Tools

### Code Editor
**VS Code** (Recommended - Free)
- Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Install Python extension
- Great for both C# and Python!

**Alternative:**
- PyCharm Community (Free)
- Sublime Text
- Even Notepad works!

### Terminal
- **Windows:** Command Prompt or PowerShell
- **VS Code:** Built-in terminal (Ctrl + `)

## 🆘 Common First-Day Issues

### Issue: "python is not recognized"
**Solution:** Python not in PATH
1. Find Python installation
2. Add to system PATH
3. Restart terminal
4. See QUICK_START.md for details

### Issue: "No module named X"
**Solution:** Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: "Can't activate venv"
**Solution:** Try:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Issue: "IndentationError"
**Solution:** Python is sensitive to indentation
- Use 4 spaces per level
- Don't mix tabs and spaces
- VS Code helps with this!

## 🎓 Learning Tips from Claude

### For .NET Developers:

**What's Similar:**
- Variables, functions, classes
- if/else, loops, logic
- OOP concepts
- Same programming thinking

**What's Different:**
- No type declarations
- No semicolons
- Indentation matters!
- snake_case not camelCase
- Different keywords (and, or, not)

**How to Learn Fast:**
1. **Stop comparing** - Python is Python, not C#
2. **Embrace differences** - They make Python powerful
3. **Type everything** - Don't copy-paste
4. **Experiment** - Break things on purpose
5. **Ask Claude** - I'm here to help!

## 🤝 How Claude Code Can Help

### Ask me anything!

**Good questions:**
- "Explain what `enumerate()` does in simple terms"
- "What's the C# equivalent of list comprehension?"
- "Why does Python use `self` instead of `this`?"
- "Show me an example of using dictionaries"
- "Help me understand this error: [paste error]"

**I will:**
- Explain concepts in relation to C#
- Break down complex code line-by-line
- Provide examples and diagrams
- Help debug your code
- Create additional exercises if needed

**Just say:**
- "I don't understand X"
- "Can you explain Y?"
- "Show me an example of Z"
- "What's wrong with my code?"
